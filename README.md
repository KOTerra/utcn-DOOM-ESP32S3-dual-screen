Dual Screen ESP32+ESP32S3 DOOM port

Project for UTCN CTI third year Design with MicroProcessors course.

This is a fork of Badlogic's mcugdx framework(a cousin of libgdx)
It adds communication between an ESP32S3 which runs the actual DOOM port and a second regular ESP32 which processes dualshock4 input through bluetooth adds a second oled screen to show the player stats.
